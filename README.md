# samp-bugs

Track all known SA:MP bugs, and if we've fixed them in open.mp.

When you submit a bug, name it either `[Server] The Bug`, `[Client] The Bug`, or `[Misc] The Bug` (NPCs, browser, server list, etc).  When we know that the bug is not present in the open.mp reimplementation, we'll close it.
