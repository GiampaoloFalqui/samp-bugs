# samp-bugs
Track all known SA:MP bugs, and if we've fixed them in open.mp.

When you submit a bug, tag it with either `Server`, `Client`, or `Misc` (NPCs, browser, server list, etc).  When we know that the bug is not present in the open.mp reimplementation, we'll close it.  Also please add the `fixes.inc` label if you know it is a bug fixed in that library (just for reference, we (hopefully) won't need that library any more).  Other labels we'll add as-and-when.
